# Introduction

What is MOODLE? This is a funny name for a powerful learning tool. Moodle is software that provides an online learning space for all your virtual classes. You can access the Moodle login from the UB website.

## Getting Started

1. The first thing you need to do is to access Moodle from the Moodle Home page:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Navigate to Moodle from the UB Homepage'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapter_1/UB_Homepage.png") 
```

2. At the Moodle HomePage, click "Login" at the top right of the screen:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Login to Moodle'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapter_1/Moodle_Homepage.png") 
```

## Authenticate using LDAP

3. You will now have to authenticate through the active directory LDAP. When you click Login from Moodle, you are taken to the Office 365 login page:
```{r out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Navigate to Moodle from the UB Homepage'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapter_1/Microsoft_Sign_In_Page.png") 
```
<br><br>
4. Sign in with your UB-issued email:
```{r out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Use your UB email to sign in'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapter_1/Sign_in_with_UB_email.png") 
```
<br><br>
5. You will be taken to UB Office 365 sign-on page:
```{r out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Popup taking you to UB sign in page'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapter_1/Taking_you_to_signin.png") 
```
<br><br>
6. Use your UB Password to sign in from the university sign-in page:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'The UB Office 365 sign-in page'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapter_1/UB_Sign_In.png") 
```
<br><br>
7. Confirm your identity using the mobile Authenticator app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en&pli=1)):
```{r out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Instrutions to approve your sign in'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapter_1/Approve_sign_in_request.png") 
```
<br><br>
8. Approve your sign in by typing the number shown on your approve request in the Authenticator:
```{r out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Approve your sign in by typing the number in the Authenticator'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapter_1/Authenticator_dialog.png")
```
